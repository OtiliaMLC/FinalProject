PROJECT IDEA: Bootstrap Budget Tracker
A marketing campaign manager for small businesses and startups on tight budgets

========================================
DESCRIPTION
========================================

This web application helps small business owners and startup founders track their marketing campaigns, 
monitor spending, and calculate ROI without expensive marketing software. Users can create campaigns, 
input performance data, and get instant insights on what's working and what's not.

The app is designed for entrepreneurs who need to make every marketing dollar count - they can see 
which channels give the best return, get alerts when budgets are running low, and make data-driven 
decisions about where to invest their limited marketing budget.

- Dashboard showing all campaigns with key metrics
- SQLite database for data storage

SHOULD HAVE:
